# Section 1 — Communication Assistant/Operator Role

Confidentiality, Verbatim, Accuracy, and Words per Minute： Federal and State rules and laws provide minimum standards for Relay. Always maintain call confidentiality as outlined in Hamilton Relay’s Confidentiality Policy. All calls are processed 100% verbatim. Employees will voice all typed call content from device users and will type everything voiced from voice callers. We do not interject personal comments, paraphrase, or alter the call in any manner. The only exception is when processing a call requiring translation. It is important that device users receive accurate text. Typing errors should be minimized as
much as possible. It is also important that we are typing as quickly possible.

Professionalism： We must be professional on all calls. We may only use approved procedure language when interacting with the callers. Procedure language should be voiced in a polite and professional tone of voice. Being patient and professional with all interactions will help deliver better service to our customers and will make the call go much smoother.

Inappropriate Behavior Toward the CA/Opr: If the Orig and/or Term are acting inappropriately towards you (e.g. call you names, etc.),
remain in the CA/Opr role. Call for a supervisor by pressing F1, Supervisor Procedure: Verify the inappropriate behavior. If there is no Term on the line, Voice/Type: “Supervisor here your call will be disconnected”. If there is an Orig and Term on the line, Voice/Type: “Supervisor here if you continue to
use this type of language directed to the CA/Opr, then I will have to disconnect the call”. If the callers correct the conversation, the CA/Opr will continue to process the call. If the customers continue to exhibit inappropriate behavior towards the CA/Opr, Voice/Type: “Supervisor here your call will be disconnected
